This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is JP, and I am, above all else, a storyteller. I love all kinds of media and the stories they have to offer, and I'm currently pursuing my dream of making my own stories through video games. However, to find a career in game development, I need as many relevant skills as I can get, not least of which is a knowledge of coding. Though I already have some rudimentary knowledge, I know that I have a lot to improve on, and want to refine my understanding of coding as much as I can.
